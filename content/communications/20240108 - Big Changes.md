# Big Changes

We want to let you know, that this June, 2024, we will return to the US to begin itineration and raising support.

We want to thank you for supporting us in our missions effort here in Jakarta over the past few years. We left the US to join the ministry at IES Jakarta almost 11 years ago. We appreciate your commitment to missions that has caused you to pick us up and support us regularly. That has been a great blessing for us.

We’ve not previously itinerated so we’re starting almost from scratch and we need your help. 
- We need to schedule services. 
- We need help reconnecting with the churches in the NWMN.

We’ve been primarily self-supported for the past 10 1/2 years. As we look to future ministry possibilities, we see it’s time to start raising support in the US. We look to those who already know us to help us reconnect.

Though we request your help, we do hope to be an asset to you and your ministry as well. We’re excited to share our passion for missions with {{ChurchName}}. We’re excited to share with anyone in any group you have. In the past 10 years, Mike has been a regular speaker in numerous venues in Churches, schools and retreats. Chelly leads worship regularly in our church in Jakarta. We’ve engaged in ministry will all ages, ministering to kids, young families, the elderly, and just about any demographic you’ll find in a church. We love to connect with people and help them connect with God’s purpose and His mission. We hope we can partner with you in helping your people connect, as well.
